//FUNCTIONS

//1. Argument is the input and the parameter is how the input is represented in the function.
//2. Return will stop the function, whereas console.log will print something on the console. Outside of a function, return will shoot back whatever number that it's told.

//PALINDROME

//Write a function checkPalindrome that accepts a single argument, a string. The function should return true (Boolean) if the string is a palindrome, false if it is not. Make sure your function will give the correct answer for words with capital letters.
